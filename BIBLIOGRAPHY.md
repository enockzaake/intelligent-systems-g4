## **Literature Map & Bibliography**

**Topic:** *AI-Driven Route Optimization and Delay Prediction System for Fleet Operations*

1. **Foundations of Dynamic & Stochastic Routing**

   * Dynamic vehicle routing problems: Three decades and counting by H. N. Psaraftis et al. (2016) provides a survey of Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems (DVRP).
   * A stochastic and dynamic vehicle routing problem in the Euclidean plane by D. J. Bertsimas & G. van Ryzin (1991) establishes early stochastic and dynamic VRP formulations.

2. **Data Foundations for AI Modelling**

   * Last‑mile delivery route deviations dataset: planned vs. actual routes (Konovalenko, Hvattum, Iversen, 2024) gives real-world last-mile delivery route data (planned vs actual) across two countries, with time windows, driver IDs, stop sequences, etc.
   * LaDe: The First Comprehensive Last‑mile Delivery Dataset from Industry (Wu et al., 2023) offers large-scale industry last-mile delivery data useful for model training/validation.

3. **AI and Reinforcement Learning for Route Optimization**

   * Reinforcement learning‑based routing optimization in dynamic logistics networks by Y. Gao, J. Tang & X. Liu (2022) illustrates how RL can optimize routing under dynamic conditions.

4. **Deep Learning for Delivery Delay Prediction**

   * A deep learning approach to predict supply chain delivery delay risk based on macroeconomic indicators: a case study by M. Gabellini et al. (2024) uses deep learning to predict delay risk in supply chains.
   * DeepSTA: A Spatial‑Temporal Attention Network for Logistics Delivery Timely Rate Prediction in Anomaly Conditions (Yi et al., 2025) explores advanced spatial–temporal attention networks for predicting delivery timely rates under anomalous conditions.

5. **Integration & Research Gap**

   * The path traced by these works moves from classical dynamic routing theory → data for modelling real-world deviations → AI/ML for optimization and prediction.
   * The remaining gap: **a unified system** that combines *real-time route re-optimization* (using RL or similar) with *delay prediction* (using deep/spatio-temporal models) and uses real-world deviation datasets (such as the Mendeley dataset) in large-scale fleet operations.
